# Context Memo
For my last co-op I worked at Bose Corporation, a large audio electronics company. My work revolved around writing and maintaining a large collection of programs to test the features of current and future devices. These programs are largely the responsibility of hardware teams, who are out of touch with modern developments in programming languages. The content of this wiki article is intended to present developments in the Python and Julia programming languages to hardware engineers so that they can choose the proper language when updating their programs for future projects.

This article is intended to be posted on one of the platforms used for organizational knowledge such as Atlassian Confluence. Documents of this type are generally written in a markup language, which Confluence renders. This means that style decisions (fonts, colors, headings, lists, tables) are all pre-determined and standardized. Confluence costs money, so for this paper I have used Github, which is free for students and offers a very similar setup for "wiki" style articles written in Markdown language.
