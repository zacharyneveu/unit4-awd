# Context Memo
For my last co-op I worked at Bose Corporation, a large audio electronics company. My work revolved around writing and maintaining a large collection of programs to test the features of current and future devices. These programs are largely the responsibility of hardware teams, who are out of touch with modern developments in programming languages. On co-op, this caused a variety of problems for me because programs were actively being developed using obsolete languages and tools. I wrote this article to present developments in the Python and Julia programming languages to hardware team leads so that they can select the proper language when updating their programs for future projects. Selecting a language is an important task for team leads that can save or cost hundreds of hours. The goal of this article is to provide practical advice to leads in this situation who may know very little about their options.

This article is intended to be posted on one of the platforms used for organizational knowledge such as Atlassian Confluence. At Bose, Confluence is used as a place to store how-to articles, as well as documents about best practices. The goal of posting an article on Confluence is that if this topic comes up in a meeting or in a hallway conversation, it is easy to refer someone to the document for further reference. Documents on Confluence are generally written in a plaintext markup language, which Confluence renders into formatted text. For example, `#<Title>` will render as large title text, and `+ <bullet text>` will render as a bullet. This means that style decisions (fonts, colors, headings, lists, tables) are all pre-determined and standardized. Confluence costs money, so to write this article I have used Github, which is free for students and offers a very similar setup for wiki style articles written in Markdown language.
