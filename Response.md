# Response Letter
Dear Professor Templeton,

Above is my final submission for Advanced Writing in the Technical Disciplines: Unit 4. This submission includes revisions based on feedback from Martin Boyle and Ryan Svendsen, as well as your weekly memo to the class.

Ryan and Martin had almost identical feedback to my draft. Both suggested that the context memo should include significantly more information. This is consistent with your comments for revision, so I have focused largely on expanding the context memo. Both of my peer reviewers were interested in more background material about my intended audience, the programming languages I mention, and whether I was editing this article or writing it from scratch. In revision, I have significantly expanded the context memo to include more information about all of these.

Both of my peer reviewers also shared very similar views about the content of my article. Both noted that it could benefit from trimming sentences to be simpler and use fewer words. In revision, I have made several editing passes to revise wordy sentences making content easier and faster to access. In a few places I have left extra words where they help keep my tone more casual. The reason for this is that along with being informational, this document must be somewhat persuasive. Updating programs takes a lot of work, and it is my job as the writer to convince program leads to do this. Keeping a more familiar tone is essential is essential when persuading, so in some places I have sacrificed brevity for familiarity.

Finally, I took as much advice as possible from your revision memo to the class. Changes based on your memo include a more complete description of my audience, revisions for brevity and clarity, and revisions for grammar and spelling. Wiki articles at Bose are generally written in a markup language, then rendered once posted. This means that all fonts, headers, table styles are standardized. Unfortunately this means that I was not able to change the format of my document with the level of scrutiny that you mentioned in your memo. Fortunately, the automatic formatting of Confluence and Github largely help avoid the pitfalls you mentioned in your memo, using sans-serif fonts for the web and clean and well differentiated heading levels. I think you will find that the changes to both the context memo and content of my draft has added significant value to this revision.

Thank you,
Zachary Neveu
